# mm-rare-value
If you want to see your value but are too lazy to calculate by hand

IF YOU DONT PLAY MALACHITE MINES THIS PROGRAM IS OF NO USE TO YOU!

Also have PYTHON (3.9+) INSTALLED(since i cant export for some reason)

How to use:

  1: Find your rares(regular,super,ultra,insanely,gilded,event)

  2: Fill out each question(Example: If you have 21 Bassium, for the question "# of Bassium", type in "21")

  3:Repeat until done!

  Note: If you get a question and you dont have any rares that that question is asking of, put down 0, and do NOT leave it blank(causes errors!)
